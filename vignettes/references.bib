	abstract = {Although genomewide {RNA} expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ({GSEA}) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how {GSEA} yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, {GSEA} reveals many biological pathways in common. The {GSEA} method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

Reactome thus functions both as a digital archive of manually curated human biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells.

Currently available {miRNA} target site packages in R are limited in the number of databases, types of databases and flexibility. We present {multiMiR}, a new {miRNA}–target interaction R package and database, which includes several novel features not available in existing R packages: (i) compilation of nearly 50 million records in human and mouse from 14 different databases, more than any other collection; (ii) expansion of databases to those based on disease annotation and drug {microRNAresponse}, in addition to many experimental and computational databases; and (iii) user-defined cutoffs for predicted binding strength to provide the most confident selection. Case studies are reported on various biomedical applications including mouse models of alcohol consumption, studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in human subjects, and human cell line models of bladder cancer metastasis. We also demonstrate how {multiMiR} was used to generate testable hypotheses that were pursued experimentally.},

Here, we present {miEAA} 2.0, supporting {miRNA} input from ten frequently investigated organisms. To facilitate inclusion of {miEAA} in workflow systems, we implemented an Application Programming Interface ({API}). Users can perform {miRNA} set enrichment analysis using either the web-interface, a dedicated Python package, or custom remote clients. Moreover, the number of category sets was raised by an order of magnitude. We implemented novel categories like annotation confidence level or localisation in biological compartments. In combination with the {miRBase} {miRNA}-version and {miRNA}-to-precursor converters, {miEAA} supports research settings where older releases of {miRBase} are in use. The web server also offers novel comprehensive visualizations such as heatmaps and running sum curves with background distributions. We demonstrate the new features with case studies for human kidney cancer, a biomarker study on Parkinson’s disease from the {PPMI} cohort, and a mouse model for breast cancer.

However, few studies have examined the rationales of these enrichment analysis strategies. Using both microarray and {RNA}-seq data, we show that gene pairs with functional links in pathways tended to have positively correlated expression levels, which could result in an imbalance between the up- and downregulated genes in particular pathways. We then show that the imbalance could greatly reduce the statistical power for finding disease-associated pathways through the analysis of all-{DE} genes. Further, using gene expression profiles from five types of tumours, we illustrate that the separate analysis of up- and downregulated genes could identify more pathways that are really pertinent to phenotypic difference. In conclusion, analysing up- and downregulated genes separately is more powerful than analysing all of the {DE} genes together.},

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (\&gt;25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce “surrogate variable analysis” ({SVA}) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. {SVA} can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply {SVA} to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies.

	abstract = {Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression ({DGE}) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. {edgeR} is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.Availability: The package is freely available under the {LGPL} licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).Contact:  mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},

	abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput {PCR} data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for {RNA}-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both {RNA}-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Many studies have investigated the differential expression of {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) in disease states and between different treatments, tissues and developmental stages. Given a list of perturbed {miRNAs}, it is common to predict the shared pathways on which they act. The standard test for functional enrichment typically yields dozens of significantly enriched functional categories, many of which appear frequently in the analysis of apparently unrelated diseases and conditions.Results: We show that the most commonly used functional enrichment test is inappropriate for the analysis of sets of genes targeted by {miRNAs}. The hypergeometric distribution used by the standard method consistently results in significant P-values for functional enrichment for targets of randomly selected {miRNAs}, reflecting an underlying bias in the predicted gene targets of {miRNAs} as a whole. We developed an algorithm to measure enrichment using an empirical sampling approach, and applied this in a reanalysis of the gene ontology classes of targets of {miRNA} lists from 44 published studies. The vast majority of the {miRNA} target sets were not significantly enriched in any functional category after correction for bias. We therefore argue against continued use of the standard functional enrichment method for {miRNA} targets.Availability and implementation: A Python script implementing the empirical algorithm is freely available at http://sgjlab.org/empirical-go/.Contact:sam.griffiths-jones@manchester.ac.uk or janine.lamb@manchester.ac.{ukSupplementary} information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {The presence of differentiated thyroid cells in thyroid cancer is critical for the antitumor response to radioactive iodide treatment, and loss of the differentiated phenotype is a key hallmark of iodide-refractory metastatic disease. The role of {microRNAs} ({miRNA}) in fine-tuning gene expression has become a major regulatory mechanism by which developmental and pathologic processes occur. In this study, we performed next-generation sequencing and expression analysis of eight papillary thyroid carcinomas ({PTC}) to comprehensively characterize {miRNAs} involved in loss of differentiation. We found that only a small set of abundant {miRNAs} is differentially expressed between {PTC} tissue and normal tissue from the same patient. In addition, we integrated computational prediction of potential targets and {mRNA} sequencing and identified a master {miRNA} regulatory network involved in essential biologic processes such as thyroid differentiation. Both mature products of mir-146b ({miR}-146b-5p and -3p) were among the most abundantly expressed {miRNAs} in tumors. Specifically, we found that {miR}-146b-3p binds to the 3′-untranslated region of {PAX}8 and sodium/iodide symporter ({NIS}), leading to impaired protein translation and a subsequent reduction in iodide uptake. Furthermore, our findings show that {miR}-146b and {PAX}8 regulate each other and share common target genes, thus highlighting a novel regulatory circuit that governs the differentiated phenotype of {PTC}. In conclusion, our study has uncovered the existence of a {miR}-146b-3p/{PAX}8/{NIS} regulatory circuit that may be exploited therapeutically to modulate thyroid cell differentiation and iodide uptake for improved treatment of advanced thyroid cancer.

In recent years, the interaction between {miRNAs} and their target genes has become one of the mainstream directions for drug development. As a large-scale biological database that mainly provides {miRNA}–target interactions ({MTIs}) verified by biological experiments, {miRTarBase} has undergone five revisions and enhancements. The database has accumulated \&gt;2 200 449 verified {MTIs} from 13 389 manually curated articles and {CLIP}-seq data. An optimized scoring system is adopted to enhance this update’s critical recognition of {MTI}-related articles and corresponding disease information. In addition, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and disease-related variants related to the binding efficiency of {miRNA} and target were characterized in {miRNAs} and gene 3′ untranslated regions. {miRNA} expression profiles across extracellular vesicles, blood and different tissues, including exosomal {miRNAs} and tissue-specific {miRNAs}, were integrated to explore {miRNA} functions and biomarkers. For the user interface, we have classified attributes, including {RNA} expression, specific interaction, protein expression and biological function, for various validation experiments related to the role of {miRNA}. We also used seed sequence information to evaluate the binding sites of {miRNA}. In summary, these enhancements render {miRTarBase} as one of the most research-amicable {MTI} databases that contain comprehensive and experimentally verified annotations.

Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure ({CAMERA}) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. {CAMERA} is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that {CAMERA} recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. {CAMERA} can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

However, few studies have examined the rationales of these enrichment analysis strategies. Using both microarray and {RNA}-seq data, we show that gene pairs with functional links in pathways tended to have positively correlated expression levels, which could result in an imbalance between the up- and downregulated genes in particular pathways. We then show that the imbalance could greatly reduce the statistical power for finding disease-associated pathways through the analysis of all-{DE} genes. Further, using gene expression profiles from five types of tumours, we illustrate that the separate analysis of up- and downregulated genes could identify more pathways that are really pertinent to phenotypic difference. In conclusion, analysing up- and downregulated genes separately is more powerful than analysing all of the {DE} genes together.},
