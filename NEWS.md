# MIRit 0.99.3

This version fixes a bug in the `topologicalAnalysis()` function that
prevented the use of a functional progress bar during permutation testing.
Moreover, the example for the `addDifferentialExpression()` function has been updated to reduce its running time.

# MIRit 0.99.2

MIRit now allows to filter the pathways used for topological analysis based
on the number of nodes.

# MIRit 0.99.1

Functional enrichment analyses and TAIPA now use cached databases to reduce
running times.

# MIRit 0.99.0

Initial version for Bioconductor submission.
