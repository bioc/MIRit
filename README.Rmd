## Overview

`MIRit` (miRNA integration tool) is an open-source R package that aims to facilitate the comprehension of microRNA (miRNA) biology through the integrative analysis of gene and miRNA expression data deriving from different platforms, including microarrays, RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics. Given their regulatory importance, a complete characterization of miRNA dysregulations results crucial to explore the molecular networks that may lead to the insurgence of complex diseases. To this purpose, we developed MIRit, an all-in-one framework that provides flexible and powerful methods for performing integrative miRNA-mRNA multi-omic analyses from start to finish.

## Installation

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `MIRit` from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("MIRit")
```

Alternatively, the development version of `MIRit` can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/jacopo-ronchi/MIRit) with:

```{r 'install_dev', eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("jacopo-ronchi/MIRit")
```

## Usage

For detailed instructions on how to use `MIRit` for integrative miRNA-mRNA analysis, please refer to the package vignette on
[Bioconductor](). Alternatively, you can refer to the [documentation website](http://jacopo-ronchi.github.io/MIRit).

## Citation

If you use `MIRit` in published research, please cite the corresponding paper:

```{r 'citation', eval = requireNamespace('MIRit')}
print(citation('MIRit'), bibtex = TRUE)
```

Please note that the `MIRit` package was made possible thanks to many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that the `MIRit` project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Development tools

* Continuous code testing is possible thanks to [GitHub actions](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/usethis-1-6-0/)  through `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('usethis')`, `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('remotes')`, and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('rcmdcheck')` customized to use [Bioconductor's docker containers](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/) and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('BiocCheck')`.
* Code coverage assessment is possible thanks to [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh) and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('covr')`.
* The [documentation website](http://jacopo-ronchi.github.io/MIRit) is automatically updated thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('pkgdown')`.
* The code is styled automatically thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('styler')`.
* The documentation is formatted thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('devtools')` and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('roxygen2')`.

For more details, check the `dev` directory.

This package was developed using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('biocthis')`.
