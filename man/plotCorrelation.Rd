\usage{
plotCorrelation(
  mirnaObj,
  mirna,
  gene,
  condition,
  showCoeff = TRUE,
  regression = TRUE,
  useRanks = FALSE,
  lineCol = "red",
  lineType = "dashed",
  lineWidth = 0.8,
  pointSize = 3,
  colorScale = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mirnaObj}{A \code{\link[=MirnaExperiment-class]{MirnaExperiment}} object
containing miRNA and gene data}

\item{mirna}{The name of the miRNA for which we want to observe the
correlation}

\item{gene}{The name of the gene for which we want to observe the
correlation}

\item{condition}{It must be the column name of a variable specified in the
metadata (colData) of a \code{\link[=MirnaExperiment-class]{MirnaExperiment}} object;
or, alternatively, it must be a character/factor object that specifies
group memberships (eg. c("healthy, "healthy", "disease", "disease"))}

\item{showCoeff}{Logical, whether to show the correlation coeffficient or
not. Note that the "R" is used for Pearson's correlation", "rho" for
Spearman's correlation, and "tau" for Kendall's correlation. Default is TRUE}

\item{regression}{Logical, whether to display a linear/monotonic regression
line that fits miRNA-gene correlation data. Default is TRUE}

\item{useRanks}{Logical, whether to represent non-parametric correlation
analyses (Spearman's and Kendall's correlations) through rank-transformed
data. Note that in this case, linear regression is performed on ranked
data instead of monotonic regression. Default is FALSE}

\item{lineCol}{It must be an R color name that specifies the color of
the regression line. Default is \code{red}. All available colors can be listed
with \code{\link[grDevices:colors]{grDevices::colors()}}}

\item{lineType}{It specifies the line type used for the regression line. It
must be either 'blank', 'solid', 'dashed' (default), 'dotted', 'dotdash',
'longdash' or 'twodash'}

\item{lineWidth}{The width of the fitted regression line (default is 0.8)}

\item{pointSize}{The size of points in the correlation plot (default is 3)}

\item{colorScale}{It must be a named character vector where values
correspond to R colors, while names coincide with the groups specified in
the \code{condition} parameter (eg. c("healthy" = "green", "disease" = "red")).
Default is NULL, in order to use the default color scale}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{ggplot} containing the correlation scatter plot.
}
\description{
This function creates a scatter plot that shows the correlation between
miRNA and gene expression levels. This is useful after correlation
analysis performed through the \code{\link[=mirnaIntegration]{mirnaIntegration()}} function, to
graphically visualize the quantitative effect of miRNA dysregulations on
target gene expression. Furthermore, this function performs linear/monotonic
regression to better represent the relationships between miRNA-target pairs.
}
\details{
When non-parametric correlation has been performed with the
\code{\link[=mirnaIntegration]{mirnaIntegration()}} function, a regression line can be fitted through
monotonic regression on expression levels, or through linear regression
performed on rank-transformed data. Since, ranks do not correspond to real
expression values, the default option is to perform monotonic regression
to fit a monotonic curve. To do so, this function makes use of the \code{MonoPoly}
R package, which implements the algorithm proposed by Murray et al. in 2016.

\examples{
# load example MirnaExperiment object
obj <- loadExamples()

# perform miRNA-target integration
obj <- mirnaIntegration(obj)

# plot correlation between miR-34a and PAX8 with monotonic regression curve
plotCorrelation(obj, "hsa-miR-34a-5p", "PAX8", condition = "disease")
